## DH To Me

As I began my journey into the expansive realm of digital humanities, I was really unsure as to what the subject entailed. This is now my final class within DH and I have definitely grown to further understand what digital humanities are as a whole. As a marketing major at the Luter School, I saw digital humanities as an opportunity to expand my horizons in the digital world and make me more prepared for future employment. When the course began, digital humanities seemed to be just another way to portray information. While that is partially correct, more is encompassed by digital humanities. After deliberating in the classroom and on my own time, it is clear that digital humanities are more than just online platforms. Digital humanities encourage interaction and discussion further than any article or paper could so. Its innate interactivity makes this clear. 

My final definition, reflecting on the course, is as follows, “Digital humanities is the use of modern-day technologies to connect multiple disciplines. Furthermore, digital humanities is an avenue to make older material and studies more accessible in modern society. Digital humanities use technology to inform and/or persuade its intended audience.” Informing and persuading were the two most common messages in all of the projects seen in class, so it seemed necessary to include them within the definition itself.
