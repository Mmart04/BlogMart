## DH To Me

As I began my journey into the expansive realm of digital humanities, I was really unsure as to what the subject entailed. This is now my final class within DH and I have definitely grown to further understand what digital humanities are as a whole. As a marketing major at the Luter School, I saw digital humanities as an opportunity to expand my horizons in the digital world and make me more prepared for future employment. When the course began, digital humanities seemed to be just another way to portray information. While that is partially correct, more is encompassed by digital humanities. After deliberating in the classroom and on my own time, it is clear that digital humanities are more than just online platforms. Digital humanities encourage interaction and discussion further than any article or paper could so. Its innate interactivity makes this clear. 

My final definition, reflecting on the course, is as follows, “Digital humanities is the use of modern-day technologies to connect multiple disciplines. Furthermore, digital humanities is an avenue to make older material and studies more accessible in modern society. Digital humanities use technology to inform and/or persuade its intended audience.” Informing and persuading were the two most common messages in all of the projects seen in class, so it seemed necessary to include them within the definition itself. 

## Readings

Since this class is a writing-intensive course, the readings did not have the same influence on my understanding of DH as they once did in the intro to digital humanities course. I felt that this course’s readings did a very good job of informing me how to use certain programs like GitHub. Additionally, the readings provided guidance to our whole class on how to write a grant and follow certain guidelines for it to be taken as a serious submission.

“What Goes Inside a Typical Grant Proposal” by Ellen W. Gorsevski, was a pivotal reading in my journey in writing my grant proposal. As shown in the tweet above, that reading allowed me to realize that within a grant proposal, the finite details are the parts that separate a good grant from a great grant.

Lastly, one reading that stood out among the rest was “Shitty First Drafts” by Anne Lamott. This was the most widely applicable reading throughout this course. I wish that it was earlier in the course material because it challenges the way in which I typically write papers. Usually, I try to make my first draft as perfect as possible since it leads to more minor editing later. Lamott points out that getting all the ideas down and then trimming them could be very useful. Her perspective on the first draft did not change how I write my first draft, but how I prepare to write it. Now my outlining phase is much longer and more in-depth in order to narrow down into the key ideas.

## Assignments

Coming into this class I have never used GitHub before and being able to add another program to my arsenal is great and definitely the best part of this class. Of the four research blogs, my favorite was the ‘Review Blog’. The review blog assignment was our chance as a class to analyze accomplished DH projects and find what makes each project so exceptional.
My review blog was on the project [Southern Mosaic](https://adityajain15.github.io/lomax/). For the first time I was able to analyze a very comprehensive DH project and rationalize the workload it takes to accomplish a  significant DH project.

## Conclusion

Overall, this course has allowed me to develop new skills and allowed me to expand my writing abilities. When I chose the digital humanities minor and chose this course, my goal was to learn new programs that were not offered in my major and expand my scholarly knowledge. This is one of the last courses of my collegiate life since I will be graduating in May 2022. I am pleased and excited for the road ahead since I feel that this course has further developed my writing ability to the caliber necessary for my future. Additionally, this course helped me expand the type of academic information I was receiving. Being a business administration major with a concentration in marketing, there is little if any overlap within digital humanities. Lastly, now that this class has concluded, I feel that I can officially claim myself as a true digital humanist.
