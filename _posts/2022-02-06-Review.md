*Southern Mosaic* is a digital humanities project that tracks John and Ruby Lomax's journey through out the southern United States, with the purpose of collecting folk songs for the Library of Congress. Om March 31st, 1939 they left their vacation home in Port Aransas, Texas and begain their 6,502 mile journey that would last around three months long. Throughout the inital journey the Lomax's recorded more than six-hundred folk songs that were kept on one hundred and forty-two discs. This amounted to 307 pages of lyrics transcribed by Ruby Lomax. This trip was then preformed again in 1940 to collect pictures of the people and places where the Lomax's visited. The folk songs consisted of a variety of genres and each told a unique story. The project director's intention for creating this digital humanites work was to have an interactive collection of the original texts and recordings from the Lomax's journey.
