*Southern Mosaic* is a digital humanities project that tracks John and Ruby Lomax's journey throughout the southern United States to collect folk songs for the Library of Congress. Om March 31st, 1939, they left their vacation home in Port Aransas, Texas, and began their 6,502-mile journey that would last around three months long. The Lomax’s recorded more than six-hundred folk songs kept on one hundred and forty-two discs throughout the initial trip. This amounted to 307 pages of lyrics transcribed by Ruby Lomax. This trip was then performed again in 1940 to collect pictures of the people and places where the Lomax's visited. The folk songs consisted of various genres, and each told a unique story. The project director's intention for creating this digital humanities work was to have an interactive collection of the original texts and recordings from Lomax's journey.

## Design

The project director's design allowed for the seemingly endless number of recordings and field notes to be manageable and digestible by any user. After providing the background of Ruby and John Lomax, the DH project follows the sequential order of the Lomax's journey by dividing the information on a state-to-state basis. The project director uses a map that takes the user than the possible route taken. This was done through the dates placed on the recordings and field notes. In addition, the project director did an excellent job of allowing the information to tell the story itself. The project director would only comment throughout the project to add context.

While this design was adequate for the user to follow the order in which data was collected, it could have been improved. By implementing short-cuts on the side of the page, the user would be able to more easily navigate from state to state rather than scroll through the entire work to get to some of the later states like South Carolina and Georgia. While the design did leave some room for improvement, the project’s interactivity was incredible.
