*Southern Mosaic* is a digital humanities project that tracks John and Ruby Lomax's journey throughout the southern United States to collect folk songs for the Library of Congress. Om March 31st, 1939, they left their vacation home in Port Aransas, Texas, and began their 6,502-mile journey that would last around three months long. The Lomaxâ€™s recorded more than six-hundred folk songs kept on one hundred and forty-two discs throughout the initial trip. This amounted to 307 pages of lyrics transcribed by Ruby Lomax. This trip was then performed again in 1940 to collect pictures of the people and places where the Lomax's visited. The folk songs consisted of various genres, and each told a unique story. The project director's intention for creating this digital humanities work was to have an interactive collection of the original texts and recordings from Lomax's journey.
