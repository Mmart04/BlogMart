 # TEI
 
The process of learning and implementing TEI was a familiar experience to me. 'TEI' stands for Text Encoding Initiative and is a set of standardized XML (extensible Markup Language). Throughout my time at Christopher Newport University, I have had the opportunity to learn moderate amounts of Python and HTML. Having this background enhanced my understanding of TEI and how it can be used to encode Bram Stoker's "Dracula’s Guest". I happened to be assigned one of my favorite parts from the reading so being able to comb through one of the more descriptive sections of the reading was more enjoyable then one of the more plain sections of the reading.

The initial step in marking "Dracula's Guest" was to analyze the text within Google Docs. Utilizing the comment feature within Google Docs made it very easy to pick out specific sections within my assigned portion that needed to be marked using XML. Depicted above are the results of highlighting the pieces where XML will be implemented using the Oxygen XML software. 

The first time I read through “Dracula’s Guest,” I was enthralled by the story and not focused on Stoker’s writing structure. His simple but effective structure of using a section break, showing that some time has passed since the initial description of the character being battered by the elements, was genuinely effective. In my first read-through, I glossed over that simple detail and continued reading; through further analyzing the reading, I realized the purpose and effectivity of the section break’s use.

The final portion of the TEI process is to mark the text using the markup language within a program named 'Oxygen XML.’ Personally, this was the easiest part of the whole process. As forementioned, my familiarity with coding with other languages made using XML very simple once I was given the correct tags by my professor Dr. Stover. The above screenshot does look intimidating to the untrained eye. However, minimal marking had to be performed on this section due to its length and simplicity.

Initially, the page break was supposed to be marked differently from the other paragraphs of texts. Still, through trial and error, Dr. Stover and I found that using the paragraph tags depicted above was the best method without causing an error in the code. This was the only hiccup throughout the entire process of marking this section of “Dracula’s Guest.”

TEI is a unique concept that I never knew about until this assignment, and I am now left wondering why it is not done more on digital texts. If TEI were to become standard on digital text sites, it would eliminate the frustrations of reading and analyzing more advanced literature.
