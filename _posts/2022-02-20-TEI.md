 # TEI
 
The process of learning and implementing TEI was a familiar experience to me. 'TEI' stands for Text Encoding Initiative and is a set of standardized XML (extensible Markup Language). Throughout my time at Christopher Newport University, I have had the opportunity to learn moderate amounts of Python and HTML. Having this background enhanced my understanding of TEI and how it can be used to encode Bram Stoker's "Draculaâ€™s Guest.
