![Profile Picture](https://Mmart04.github.io/BlogMart/images/Profile.jpg)

My name is **Michael Martorano** and I am currently a senior enrolled at Christopher Newport University. Being from New Jersey I am often asked how I ended up in Newport News, Virginia.
## Why CNU?
As a baseball player the recruiting process is long and often stressful. However, once I look my offical visit to CNU, the choice became clear on where I wanted to advance my atheltic and and academic career. One of the main attractions as a high school student besides for a great baseball program was the [Luter School of Business](https://cnu.edu/academics/departments/business/). Having a well recognized business school was essential in making my decision reguarding the future of my education.
## Campus Involvement
Although my intital reason for coming to CNU was for baseball, I have developed life long friendships and have joined multiple other organizations that have helped me become more well-rounded as an individual. One of these organizations is the [Captains' Educational Enrichment Fund](https://www.linkedin.com/company/captain's-educational-enrichment-fund/mycompany/). This club as developed one of my interests in the stock market and has expanded my horizons for posible jobs after college. The other organization I am a member of is [Pi Kappa Alpha Fraternity](https://www.instagram.com/cnupike/). Joing Pike has been I life changing experience that lead me to meet some of my friends for life. Additionally, I was fortunate to be voted on by my peers to become the External Vice President. I would not be the man I am today without expanding my horizons beyond just baseball.
