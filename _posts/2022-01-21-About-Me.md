# The Collegiate Life of Michael Martorano
![Profile Picture](https://Mmart04.github.io/BlogMart/images/Profile.jpg)

My name is **Michael Martorano**, and I am currently a senior enrolled at Christopher Newport University.  Being from New Jersey, I am often asked how I ended up in Newport News, Virginia.

## Why CNU?

As a baseball player, the recruiting process is long and often stressful. However, once I looked at my official visit to CNU, the choice became clear on where I wanted to advance my athletic and academic career. Besides a great baseball program, one of the main attractions as a high school student was the
[Luter School of Business](https://cnu.edu/academics/departments/business/). Having a well-recognized business school was essential in making my decision regarding the future of my education.

## Campus Involvement
Although my initial reason for coming to CNU was baseball, I have developed lifelong friendships. I have joined multiple other organizations that have helped me become more well-rounded as an individual. One of these organizations is the [Captains' Educational Enrichment Fund](https://www.linkedin.com/company/captain's-educational-enrichment-fund/mycompany/). This club as developed one of my interests in the stock market and has expanded my horizons for possible jobs after college. The other organization I am a member of is [Pi Kappa Alpha Fraternity](https://www.instagram.com/cnupike/). Joining Pike has been a life-changing experience that led me to meet some of my friends for life. Additionally, I was fortunate to be voted on by my peers to become the External Vice President. I would not be the man I am today without expanding my horizons beyond just baseball.

## [Athletics](https://www.cnusports.com/sports/baseball/roster/michael-martorano/17311)
Baseball has been an essential part of my life since I could pick up a bat. My goal was always to play at a college level, and having that dream become a reality is incredible. Years of traveling all over the country to play in various tournaments led me to my final season of competitive baseball. It is very upsetting to close this chapter in my life; however, all of the experiences from baseball lead me to discover my passion for sports as a whole.

## Career Interests
I aspire to become the general manager of any major professional sports team. This is a lofty goal; however, I think it is possible. The track to get to this position will be long and typically is the product of extensive self-selling and connecting with the right people. I believe my academic, athletic, and social experiences have well prepared me for this career path. Furthermore, I am a huge New York sports fan, so I have followed the Yankees, Rangers, and Giants my entire life. It only seems natural for my professional career to involve sports since the previous twenty-one years have all included sports in them.
